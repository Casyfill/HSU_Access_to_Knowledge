# 3.4  Urban Statistics
* Elena Korotkova *

While the termin "Urban data" sounds more or less clear, to understand the actual landscape of urban data one need to dig into the structure of cityÕs governing body, as its composition will have a great impact over data available and its specifics. We will also compare datasets offered in Russia to the ones made accessible by other countries.
