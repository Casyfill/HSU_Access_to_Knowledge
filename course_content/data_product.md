## 3.6  Data product
*Egor Kotov*

Data analysis and exploration are very important on itÕs own, yet the format and its practical implementation of its outcome might vary - from a paper report or policy recommendation to autonomous decision-making system. Data product part will articulate what data product can be and how to develop one. We will also spend time on practical tools and methods, including some programming and geospatial techniques, that students can find useful during their final research.

## Practical assignment

1.	collect data, using automated tools and techniques 
2.	process and clean the data 
3.	facilitate the exploratory phase of the research, preparing a general report on the dataset 
4.	create several visual representations of dataset, including spatial representation. 
5.	create a consequent narrative, discussing the research, itÕs hypotesis, data, metods, and findings.
