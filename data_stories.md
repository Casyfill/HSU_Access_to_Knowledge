# 3.5  Data stories
*Philipp Kats, Guest Speaker:TBD*

Good research is always worth a story. On the other hand, ÒThe medium is the messageÓ, or, in other words, any format has itÕs influence over the content, it has its strenghts, weaknesses and requirements. During the session weÕll discuss different formats for your story, from scientific article and visualization to movie clip or graphical poster. We will overview multiple examples of research representation, and discuss, how good representation can benefit both research and design.
