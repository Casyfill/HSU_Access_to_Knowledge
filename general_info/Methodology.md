## 1.1  Methodology

The course is designed to close the gap between pure academic research course and  urban planning. It explains various research methods relevant to Urban Design practice and basic rules of information processing, while also providing general knowledge on what urban data is and where to find the relevant datasets. The course consists of the two main parts: 

- a) General skill-set (4 weeks) 
- b) Urban research (3 weeks). 

Each part will be supported by the set of practical labs, seminars and research assignments, including the midterm and final projects.
